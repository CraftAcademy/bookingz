Hello User!
Welcome to the Bookingz app, it allows you to book a room for conferences or other events.
Once you have logged in you will be redirected to the [Dashboard](http://bookingz.herokuapp.com/) and get an overview of the rooms' availability on any given date.

### How do I book a room?

Just follow these simple steps:

  * Choose the date using the navigation arrows on top of your _Dashboard_
  * Click on the desired time slot in your room of interest
  * Fill in the name you want to be displayed on the booking
  * Select a starting and finishing time for your event
  * Click the `Create` button
